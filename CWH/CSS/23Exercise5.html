                        <p>Saitama (Japanese: サイタマ) is a fictional character who is the titular protagonist of the Japanese manga series One-Punch Man created by One. Saitama, an unassociated and independently-acting superhero, hails from Z-City and performs heroic deeds as a hobby. For three years straight, Saitama had trained hard enough to become the strongest being and can defeat any enemy with a single punch. However, because of his unmatched power, he has been left with no real challenge from his supervillain or criminal adversaries, leaving him unfulfilled and bored. He becomes the reluctant mentor of Genos, a cyborg seeking revenge against another cyborg who killed his family and destroyed his hometown, after Saitama defeats a monster that defeated Genos. With Genos, Saitama learns about the Hero Association, a professional organization that combats monsters and protects the Earth.</p>

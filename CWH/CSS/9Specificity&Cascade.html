    <ol>
        <li><b>Position and Order of Appearance:</b> The order in which your CSS rules Appear.</li>
        <li><b>Specificity:</b> An algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest Match.</li>
        <li><b>Origin:</b> The order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS.</li>
        <li><b>Importance:</b> Some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
            Lets look into all these one by one.</li>
    </ol>
